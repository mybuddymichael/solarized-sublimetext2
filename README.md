Solarized for Sublime Text 2
============================

Translations of Ethan Schoonover's popular [Solarized][] colorscheme
[already exist][textmate-solarized], but most don't use accurate colors.
(Sublime Text 2's default implementation is especially egregious.) This
fixes that. It usually aims to be as true to Ethan's original syntax
highlighting as possible, but there are instances where consistency with
the rest of the colorscheme is chosen over consistency with Ethan's
choices.

**To install:**
- Run `git clone git://github.com/mybuddymichael/solarized-sublimetext2.git`.
- `cd solarized-sublimetext2`
- Copy the .tmTheme files into your Sublime [data folder][].
